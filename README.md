# Rockbuster Stealth SQL Analysis 
## Project Summary
This repository features an in-depth SQL analysis of Rockbuster Stealth’s business data, designed to address key strategic questions raised by the management board for the 2020 company strategy. The analysis explores factors such as top- and bottom-performing movies in terms of revenue, average rental periods, customer locations, high-value customer segments, and regional sales differences. By leveraging SQL, the data is queried and analyzed to generate actionable insights, which are then visualized for clarity. The project demonstrates not only SQL proficiency but also the ability to tackle complex business challenges with insights relevant across industries.

## Key Questions & Objectives
